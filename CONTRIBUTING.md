# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. 

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/dynameh.git

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

Make sure the tests pass:

    npm run test

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make sure the tests pass:

    npm run test
    
Make sure your code conforms to our code style:

    npm run lint

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Make sure your code conforms to our linting policy.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
